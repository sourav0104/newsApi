            <h1>Importance of news</h1>
            <p>News is important for a number of reasons within a society. Mainly to inform the public about events that are around them and may affect them. 

                Often news is for entertainment purposes too; to provide a distraction of information about other places people are unable to get to or have little influence over. News can make people feel connected too.
                
                News is important as a social gathering space too, hence newspapers either online or physical place an emphasis on news. Where there are a lot of people gathered there is opportunity to advertise. This advertising sometimes can cause a conflict of interest in the way news is reported.</p>
